# Exhaustion-Skiba
This program uses the Skiba model to model a cyclists current energy levels given a power output history.
The model takes in a hypothetical power output curve that would be provided by the cyclist. It then calculates the distance between the cyclists output and their critical power level.
This difference is used to determine the rate of recovery or the rate of exertion in the cyclist using constants found experimentally.
This is done for every point in time to show a fairly accurate account of a cyclists energy levels throughout a race.
